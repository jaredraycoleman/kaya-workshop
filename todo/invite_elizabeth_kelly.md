Subject: Invitation to Participate: AI & Indigenous Language Revitalization Workshop

Hello Ms. Kelly,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to invite you to participate in a workshop we're organizing on AI and Indigenous Language Revitalization, to be held June 8–10, 2026 at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. The workshop is supported by the National Science Foundation (Award #2542375).

The event will bring together Indigenous language teachers, linguists, archivists, and AI researchers to explore how artificial intelligence can be developed and applied responsibly in endangered language contexts. While AI tools have shown real promise for supporting documentation and revitalization, they also raise important ethical and practical questions about consent, ownership, accuracy, and long-term accountability. The goal of the workshop is to create space for cross-disciplinary dialogue that surfaces shared concerns, highlights best practices, and helps define what responsible AI engagement should look like in this area.

Given your leadership of Anthropic's Beneficial Deployments team and your background in AI safety policy, I think your perspective would be particularly valuable for these discussions. Indigenous language communities represent exactly the kind of context where getting AI deployment right from the start really matters—and where industry voices committed to beneficial applications can help shape better practices.

To make it easier to respond, here's what I'd love your input on:
- Participation: Whether you'd be interested and available to join us June 8–10 at Loyola Marymount University. We can provide support for travel.
- Colleagues: If your schedule doesn't allow, whether there's someone on your team who might be a good fit for these conversations.
- Conversation: Whether you'd be open to a short Zoom meeting in the next few weeks to discuss the workshop and how it might connect to Anthropic's work.

Thank you for considering, and for your work advancing beneficial AI applications. I look forward to the possibility of connecting soon.
