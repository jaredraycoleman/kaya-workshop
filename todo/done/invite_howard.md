Hello,

I hope this message finds its way to Howard Paden. I'm reaching out to invite him to participate in a workshop we're organizing on AI and Indigenous Language Revitalization, to be held June 8–10, 2026 at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. The workshop is supported by the National Science Foundation (Award #[2542375](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/show-award?AWD_ID=2542375)).

The event will bring together Indigenous language teachers, linguists, archivists, and AI researchers to explore how artificial intelligence can be developed and applied responsibly in endangered language contexts. While AI tools have shown real promise for supporting documentation and revitalization, they also raise important ethical and practical questions about consent, ownership, accuracy, and long-term accountability. The goal of the workshop is to create space for cross-disciplinary dialogue that surfaces shared concerns, highlights best practices, and helps define what responsible AI engagement should look like in this area.

Given his leadership as Executive Director of the Cherokee Nation Language Department and the Cherokee Nation's pioneering efforts in language technology, his perspective would be invaluable.

To make it easier to respond, here's what I'd love input on:
- Participation: Whether he'd be interested and available to join us June 8–10 at Loyola Marymount University. We can provide support for travel.
- Suggestions: Any names of others who might be interested in participating, particularly colleagues from tribal language programs. (We have limited funds for travel support, but are currently building as broad a list as possible to ensure a range of perspectives.)
- Conversation: Whether he'd be open to a short Zoom meeting in the next week or so to discuss potential workshop topics.

Thank you for passing this along, and thank you to Mr. Paden for his leadership in Cherokee language revitalization. I look forward to the possibility of connecting soon.
