Hi Christina, Tracy, and Maria,

I hope the new year is off to a good start for you all!

I wanted to follow up on my note from last month about the AI & Indigenous Language Revitalization workshop (June 8–10 at LMU). As I'm finalizing the participant list and logistics, it would be helpful to know if someone from your team will be able to join us.

As a reminder, we can provide full travel support for one participant. Let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.

Best,
Jared
