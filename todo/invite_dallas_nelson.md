Subject: Invitation to Participate: AI & Indigenous Language Revitalization Workshop

Hello Dallas,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to invite you to participate in a workshop we're organizing on AI and Indigenous Language Revitalization, to be held June 8–10, 2026 at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. The workshop is supported by the National Science Foundation (Award #2542375).

The event will bring together Indigenous language teachers, linguists, archivists, and AI researchers to explore how artificial intelligence can be developed and applied responsibly in endangered language contexts. While AI tools have shown real promise for supporting documentation and revitalization, they also raise important ethical and practical questions about consent, ownership, accuracy, and long-term accountability. The goal of the workshop is to create space for cross-disciplinary dialogue that surfaces shared concerns, highlights best practices, and helps define what responsible AI engagement should look like in this area.

I came across your work through ANPO and your previous leadership of the Lakota Language Initiative at Thunder Valley. Your experience building language programs grounded in community values—and your involvement in projects like the Lakota Avengers dub—is exactly the kind of perspective we need at this workshop. We're working to ensure that voices from tribal language programs are central to these conversations, not just academic researchers or technologists.

To make it easier to respond, here's what I'd love your input on:
- Participation: Whether you'd be interested and available to join us June 8–10 at Loyola Marymount University. We can provide support for travel.
- Suggestions: Any colleagues at ANPO or other language program leaders who might be interested in participating.
- Conversation: Whether you'd be open to a short Zoom meeting in the next few weeks to discuss your interests and potential workshop topics.

Thank you for considering, and for your work in Lakota language revitalization. I look forward to the possibility of connecting soon.
