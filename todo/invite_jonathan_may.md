Subject: Invitation to Participate: AI & Indigenous Language Revitalization Workshop

Hello Dr. May,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to invite you to participate in a workshop we're organizing on AI and Indigenous Language Revitalization, to be held June 8–10, 2026 at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. The workshop is supported by the National Science Foundation (Award #2542375).

The event will bring together Indigenous language teachers, linguists, archivists, and AI researchers to explore how artificial intelligence can be developed and applied responsibly in endangered language contexts. While AI tools have shown real promise for supporting documentation and revitalization, they also raise important ethical and practical questions about consent, ownership, accuracy, and long-term accountability. The goal of the workshop is to create space for cross-disciplinary dialogue that surfaces shared concerns, highlights best practices, and helps define what responsible AI engagement should look like in this area.

Given your work on machine translation for low-resource languages—particularly through the LORELEI and SARAL projects—I think your perspective would be especially valuable. Indigenous language communities face many of the same "more with less" challenges you've tackled, and your experience building MT systems with limited training data is directly relevant.

To make it easier to respond, here's what I'd love your input on:
- Participation: Whether you'd be interested and available to join us June 8–10 at Loyola Marymount University.
- Suggestions: Any colleagues at ISI or elsewhere who might be interested in participating.
- Conversation: Whether you'd be open to a short Zoom meeting in the next few weeks to discuss your interests and potential workshop topics.

Thank you for considering. I look forward to the possibility of connecting soon.
