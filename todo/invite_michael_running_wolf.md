Subject: Invitation to Participate: AI & Indigenous Language Revitalization Workshop

Hello Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to invite you to participate in a workshop we're organizing on AI and Indigenous Language Revitalization, to be held June 8–10, 2026 at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. The workshop is supported by the National Science Foundation (Award #2542375).

The event will bring together Indigenous language teachers, linguists, archivists, and AI researchers to explore how artificial intelligence can be developed and applied responsibly in endangered language contexts. Our goal is to create space for cross-disciplinary dialogue that surfaces shared concerns, highlights promising approaches, and helps define what responsible collaboration should look like in this space. The expected outputs include a position paper, recommendations for researchers and funders, and formation of an ongoing working group.

Your work with FLAIR at Mila and with Indigenous in AI makes you exactly the kind of voice we're hoping to include. You've been doing the hands-on work of building AI tools for Indigenous language preservation while also thinking carefully about how these technologies should be developed in partnership with communities. That combination of technical expertise and community-centered practice is central to what this workshop is trying to accomplish.

I'd be grateful if you could let me know:
- Whether you'd be interested and available to join us June 8–10 at LMU. We can provide support for travel.
- Whether you'd be open to a brief call to discuss the workshop themes and how they connect to your current work.

Thank you for considering, and for the important work you're doing at the intersection of AI and Indigenous languages.
